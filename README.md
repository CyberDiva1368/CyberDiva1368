## Hi there, I'm Ranti!




**CyberDiva1368/CyberDiva1368** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.**
Welcome to my cloud security portfolio. Here, I showcase my projects, certifications, and resources.
   I am a Cloud Security Engineer with expertise in securing AWS environments, implementing IAM best practices, and monitoring cloud security threats.
       AWS Security Projects
         CloudTrail & GuardDuty: Set up logging and threat detection.
         IAM Security: Implemented least privilege access and MFA enforcement.
         S3 Bucket Configured bucket policies, encryption, and access logging.
         Assessed AWS security posture using CIS benchmarks.

        Cloud Computing (AWS): AWS services (S3, EC2, Lambda, etc.), Cloud Security
Cybersecurity: Network Security, Cloud Security, Threat Detection
Machine Learning: Anomaly Detection, Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
Objective: Automate the process of checking S3 bucket permissions for misconfigurations.
Technologies: AWS SDK 
Description: This tool verifies S3 bucket permissions, ensuring that they are properly secured according to AWS best practices.
4. ‚òÅÔ∏è EC2 Web Application Deployment
Objective: Learn to deploy and host a web application on an AWS EC2 instance using a basic web server.
Technologies: AWS EC2, SSH, 
Description: This project demonstrates the deployment of a static web application by launching an EC2 instance, installing a web server, and hosting an HTML file. It covers essential cloud computing skills, including instance management, security group configuration, and file transfers. Cloud infrastructure!
5. ‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless API with AWS Lambda
Objective: Build a fully serverless backend application with CRUD operations using AWS services.
Technologies: AWS Lambda, API Gateway,  DynamoDB
Description: This project implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through a serverless architecture. Using AWS Lambda for computation and API Gateway for exposing RESTful endpoints, the application demonstrates how to design a scalable, cost-effective backend without managing servers. It includes robust input validation, error handling, and optional DynamoDB integration for persistent data storage. Ideal for modern web or mobile applications requiring lightweight and reliable backend solutions.
6. ‚òÅÔ∏è React App Deployment with S3 and CloudFront
Objective: Deploy a React application on AWS S3 and distribute it globally using CloudFront for optimal performance and scalability.
Technologies: React, AWS S3, CloudFront, Route 53 (optional), Python
Description: This project demonstrates the deployment of a static React web application to an S3 bucket, enabling static website hosting. The app is globally distributed via CloudFront to ensure low-latency access for users worldwide. Optional integration with Route 53 allows for custom domain and HTTPS setup. This guide covers end-to-end deployment, including build automation and infrastructure configuration, providing a cost-effective, scalable solution for hosting modern web applications.
7. ‚òÅÔ∏è Simple File Backup System with AWS Lambda
Objective: Automate file backup processes between S3 buckets using AWS Lambda and S3 Event Notifications.
Technologies: AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, 
Description: This project automates the backup of files from a source S3 bucket to a destination bucket whenever a new file is uploaded. Using serverless architecture with Lambda and S3 Event Triggers, it eliminates the need for manual backups. The implementation covers key cloud skills, including event-driven architecture, IAM role configuration, and cost-effective automation. Perfect for businesses needing reliable, scalable, and hands-free data backup solutions.
üîÆ Future Plans
This repository will be continually updated with new projects as I progress through the curriculum. I plan to expand my portfolio with more complex and advanced Cloud computing and Machine learning applications, demonstrating a broad range of skills.
 
‚ú® Thank you for checking out my portfolio! I'm excited to continue learning and building with each project, and look forward to contributing to the ever-evolving world of Cloud computing and Machine Learning!
