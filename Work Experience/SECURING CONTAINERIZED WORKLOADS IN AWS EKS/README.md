# SECURING CONTAINERIZED WORKLOADS IN AWS EKS
---

## Overview
---
I implemented end-to-end security for containerized workloads running on AWS Elastic
 Kubernetes Service (EKS). The focus was on deploying a secure Kubernetes 
environment, enforcing security policies, and proactively detecting vulnerabilities 
to ensure a robust cloud-native infrastructure.
   
 

## Steps Undertaken
---
 
1.  Secure Deployment of a Containerized Application
2.   Kubernetes Security Policy Enforcement
3.   Container Vulnerability Scanning & Image Hardening
4.   Threat Detection & Security Monitoring



 ## Conclusion
---
 
   This experience highlights my ability to design, deploy, and secure containerized 
workloads in AWS. It showcases my skills in Kubernetes security, vulnerability 
management, and threat detectionâ€”demonstrating my readiness to secure cloud-native 
applications in an enterprise environment.
