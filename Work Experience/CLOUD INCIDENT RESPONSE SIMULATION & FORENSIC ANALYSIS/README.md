# Cloud Incident Response Simulation & Forensic Analysis
---

## Overview
---

 I executed a hands-on cloud incident response simulation to assess and improve 
security resilience. This experience involved simulating an unauthorized access 
attempt to an Amazon S3 bucket, leveraging AWS security services to detect threats, 
conducting forensic analysis, and implementing remediation measures. The goal was to
 enhance security posture, mitigate risks, and establish a proactive incident 
response framework.

## Steps Undertaken
---

1. Simulating a Security Breach
2.  Threat Detection & Forensic Analysis
3. Incident Response & Mitigation
4. Security Hardening & Prevention



 ## Conclusion
---

 This experience validates my expertise in cloud incident response, forensic 
investigation, and proactive security measures. It demonstrates my ability to 
detect, analyze, and remediate security incidents in an AWS environment, showcasing 
my readiness to secure cloud infrastructures at an enterprise level.
