# SECURE WEB APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT IN AWS
---

## Overview
---

  In this experience, I successfully designed, deployed, and secured a web application
 in AWS, ensuring end-to-end encryption, threat protection, and strict access 
controls. This involved hosting a static website, implementing HTTPS with SSL/TLS 
certificates, and configuring AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to mitigate 
security threats. 
 

## Steps Undertaken
---

1.  Secure Hosting: Deployed a web application using Amazon S3 with CloudFront CDN for
 enhanced security and performance.
2. Encrypted Traffic: Implemented SSL/TLS via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to 
enforce HTTPS and encrypt all data in transit.
3.  Threat Protection: Configured AWS WAF with custom rules to block SQL injection, 
XSS, and DDoS attacks.
4.  Access Control: Enforced IAM least privilege policies and S3 bucket security to 
restrict unauthorized access.
5.   Compliance & Monitoring: Enabled AWS CloudTrail & AWS Config to track security 
events and maintain compliance.



 ## Conclusion
---

  This experience showcases real-world expertise in securing cloud-hosted 
applications, proving my ability to design, deploy, and manage security controls in 
AWS.
